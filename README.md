AngorChat is one of the most decentralized chat apps ever built. 

AngorChat is built on Nostr, and therefore doesn't rely on any centralized servers, just Nostr relays. Everyday users of AngorChat can immediately benefit from Nostr’s decentralized network. Power users can choose to further decentralization by running their own AngorChat client or Nostr relay. 

Our ReadMe is a summary about AngorChat, what it looks like, and how to use it.

## What is Nostr?

[Nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr) is a simple open protocol for creating censorship-resistant global networks.

## How to log into AngorChat

From the [Nostrchat.io](https://www.angorchat.io/) homepage choose one of the following:

**Create Nostr Account** (easiest option for first time users) — Click the button to “Create Nostr Account.” Instantly you’ll be given a new Nostr account. Once you login, it is highly recommended that you go to “Settings -> Keys” and save both your public and private keys. These keys are your access to your Nostr account, and you will need them again in the future.

**Use NIP-07 Wallet** (recommended for return users) — Choose the button “Use NIP-07 Wallet.” Install the Alby wallet browser extension. Once you install Alby you will be able to log into AngorChat. The benefit of the NIP-07 login is that you will manage your private keys locally in the Alby extension.

## How to use AngorChat

Once you enter AngorChat you can chat in the global chat, or create your own chat channel where you can invite others.

## How to run AngorChat locally 

Install dependencies
```bash
$ yarn
